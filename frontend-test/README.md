# To run app

First download the node modules by running 'npm install' via the terminal

Once this has completed enter 'npm start' in the terminal. Let me know if you have any issues.

I have tried to replicate the designs as much as possible but due to time contraints and other factors I may have missed a few things but the entire functionality of it works. Below I have written improvements on what I have done different. 

# Improvements 

Code Organization and Structure
First off, I think we can improve the overall structure of our components. Right now, we have everything packed into a few large files. By breaking down our components further, we can make our code easier to manage. For example, we could create a directory structure where each step has its own file. Additionally, we should consider creating reusable components for common elements like InfoSection, CheckboxLabel, and ErrorMessage. This will help us adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

State Management
For handling the form state, I think we could benefit from using a library like formik or react-hook-form. These libraries simplify form state management, validation, and submission, which will reduce the amount of boilerplate code we have to write and maintain. They also offer built-in validation, which can help us ensure consistency across all form steps.

Validation
Speaking of validation, using a library like yup for validation schemas would be a great move. This way, we can define our validation logic separately and apply it easily throughout our form, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors.

UI/UX Improvements
From a user experience perspective, we can make a few tweaks:

Accessibility: We need to make sure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and have appropriate ARIA roles. This includes making sure our form elements have labels and our error messages are properly associated with the inputs.
User Flow: Improving the user flow by disabling the "Next" button until the current step is valid will help guide users through the form more smoothly. Adding a loading indicator when transitioning between steps can also enhance the experience.
Responsive Design: Let’s ensure the form is fully responsive. This will involve using CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques so it looks great on all devices.
Progress Indicators: Our progress indicator could be more descriptive. Maybe a progress bar or clearer step indicators would help users see where they are in the process and what’s coming next.
Performance
To boost performance, we can use React.memo and useMemo to memoize components and expensive computations that don’t need to re-render on every state change. This can really help, especially with complex forms. Also, by managing state updates carefully, we can prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Maintainability
For maintainability, we should:

Type Checking: Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type checking. This will help us catch errors early and make the code easier to understand.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Stick to a consistent naming convention across the codebase. This makes it easier to read and maintain.
Documentation: Add comments and documentation to explain complex logic and components. This will be a lifesaver for anyone who works on this code in the future, including us.
Error Handling
Lastly, we should focus on error handling:

Graceful Error Handling: Implement error boundaries to catch JavaScript errors in our component tree. This way, the whole app won’t crash, and we can show a fallback UI instead.
Network Error Handling: Handle network errors gracefully, providing feedback to users and allowing them to retry actions where appropriate.
By tackling these areas, we can make our step form more robust, user-friendly, and easier to maintain. What do you think?
